                                                After completing my High School, I pursued a career in Software Development and received my Bachelors 
                                                Degree in Computer and Information Sciences through the University of Monash South Africa. I completed 
                                                a double major in <b>Software Development</b> and <b>Network Security</b> and intend to complete my honors and 
                                                eventually my Masters.

                                                My academic journey immersed me in the full spectrum of modern software developmentâ€”from system architecture and 
                                                cybersecurity best practices to agile methodologies, database design, and the nuanced art of coding across multiple 
                                                frameworks and languages. It was here that I discovered my passion for Java, captivated by its versatility, robustness, 
                                                and elegance in solving real-world problems. Beyond theory, Iâ€™ve honed these skills through hands-on experience, 
                                                blending academic rigor with practical execution. Today, I bring a dynamic toolkit to every project: a deep understanding 
                                                of development lifecycles, a security-first mindset, and the ability to adapt cutting-edge technologies to deliver 
                                                scalable, efficient solutions. Whether crafting intuitive applications or optimizing backend systems, I thrive on 
                                                transforming challenges into opportunities.

                                            I thrive on growth not just in theory, but in practice. My passion for software development and project management 
                                            is fuelled by relentless learning, proven by the certifications Iâ€™ve earned and the skills Iâ€™ve deployed in real-world 
                                            projects. Recently, I completed an intensive Spring Boot course, immediately applying its principles to streamline 
                                            backend systems in my work. Now, Iâ€™m turning my focus to AWS certification, with a clear roadmap to mastery: hands-on 
                                            labs, cloud architecture projects, and iterative testing. For me, education isnâ€™t just about credentials; itâ€™s about 
                                            unlocking new ways to build faster, smarter solutionsâ€”and Iâ€™m already putting the next one in motion.
