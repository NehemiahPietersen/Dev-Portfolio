        detailedDescription: "In my 3rd year of university, we were tasked with finding a client and meeting their IT needs. I was part of a team of 6 software developers. We found a local small business in Pietermaritzburg that specialized in Landscaping, gardening, nursery needs, and a variety in plant-based products to sell. After finding our client we found that the company had very little online footprint and no real management of their inventory. We came up with the solution of implementing Web Application system that would as both: a stock management system as well as an advertising tool to assist the business in the online world.\n We decided to use MongoDB for our database and Node.js for the framework of the application. The middleware we used was Express.js and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend of the Web Application. Utilizing Trello, we were able to assign tasks and manage the team coordination and communication between individual team members.\n I was responsible for designing Entity Relationship Diagram (ERP), site maps and Use case scenarios while another team member design the activity diagrams based on my use case scenarios. I also worked on developing the back end of the application, and was responsible for ensuring session cookies was up and running as well as security for the web app. While working on API endpoints, I thought of taking the initiative to suggest we implement a mobile application as to allow for user efficiency.\n Since I had knowledge of the API endpoints, I was tasked with creating the back-end connection between the mobile application and the web application. In the web app, we used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Using the correct credentials, I was able to link and communicate with the Web application via the mobile application, this was done by using the Retrtofit framework. I also implemented Firebase Crashlytics so that the we could monitor any crashes. Since the application was only to be used by the owner and his wife, there was no need to publish the application to Google Play store.\n My key achievements for this project would be: the fully operational mobile application, as well as accurate use cases and site maps and the fully operational back-end of the web application.

I Identifying and resolving data inconsistencies caused by user errors. I have had to review and rewrite outdated stored procedures to improve efficiency and align with current business logic. My dual expertise in IT Support and Database Administration allows me to bridge the gap between end-user needs and backend system stability, ensuring seamless operations across the organization.\n Upon my arrival at the company, the current Android mobile application had been removed from Google Play store for not adhering to the new google standards. I initially attempted to just upload a newer version of the application, however, due to some outdated plugins the application was not portable to a newer Gradle version with these plugins. I then took it upon myself to rewrite the mobile application. Because I had prior knowledge of mobile application development and APIs, it was easy to implement the retrofit framework and have communication between the mobile application and the API service. While developing, I took the initiative to implement some long overdue features such as: block and probe sorting, as well as, light and dark mode.\n My key achievements at DFM Technologies is: the rewrite of the mobile application and the migration of the SAP server.",
